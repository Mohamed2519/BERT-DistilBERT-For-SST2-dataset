# Text classification on SST2 Dataset
This Repo make Text classification on `SST2` dataset using various text models such as `RNN` , `LSTM` , `BERT` , `DistilBERT`

Also contain Evaluation with various evaluation metrics:
`Accuracy` `confusion matrix` `Precision` `Recall` `F1 score`  `ROC/AUC curves`

## Notebook folder contain 3 notebooks
### 1- RNN_CLS.ipynb
### 2- Lstm_CLS.ipynb
### 3- BERT&Distil_BERT_For_SST2.ipynb
